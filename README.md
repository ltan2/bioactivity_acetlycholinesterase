ChEMBL is primarily focused on bioactivity data for molecules interacting with biological targets, such as acetylcholinesterase. When you query ChEMBL for acetylcholinesterase, it provides data on small molecules, peptides, or other compounds that have been experimentally tested against this protein.


When querying for acetylcholinesterase as a target, ChEMBL provides:

Bioactivity Data:
    The interaction data between acetylcholinesterase and different molecules, including:
    IC50, EC50, Ki, or Kd values: Indicators of binding strength or inhibition potential.
    Activity Class: Compounds are classified as "active," "inactive," or "intermediate" based on thresholds.
    This helps identify potential inhibitors or activators of acetylcholinesterase.
    Assay Information:

Details about the experiments used to measure bioactivity:
Assay type (e.g., binding assay, functional assay).
Conditions under which the activity was measured (e.g., cell-free systems or whole-cell assays).
Compound Information:

Structural data for the tested molecules, often in SMILES format.
Physicochemical properties of the molecules (e.g., molecular weight, logP).
Target Context


The focus is on understanding how different molecules bioactivity interact with acetylcholinesterase, potentially identifying inhibitors that could serve as drug candidates.

pIC50 is a widely used term in pharmacology and drug discovery that refers to the negative logarithm (base 10) of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of a substance. The potency of an inhibitor refers to its ability to effectively inhibit a specific biological or biochemical process at low concentrations. It is a measure of the strength of interaction between the inhibitor and its target, such as an enzyme or receptor. In practical terms, potency indicates how much of the inhibitor is required to achieve a desired level of inhibition.
