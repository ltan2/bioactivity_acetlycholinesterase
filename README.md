ChEMBL is primarily focused on bioactivity data for molecules interacting with biological targets, such as acetylcholinesterase. When you query ChEMBL for acetylcholinesterase, it provides data on small molecules, peptides, or other compounds that have been experimentally tested against this protein.

What ChEMBL Returns for Acetylcholinesterase
When querying for acetylcholinesterase as a target, ChEMBL provides:

Bioactivity Data:

The interaction data between acetylcholinesterase and different molecules, including:
IC50, EC50, Ki, or Kd values: Indicators of binding strength or inhibition potential.
Activity Class: Compounds are classified as "active," "inactive," or "intermediate" based on thresholds.
This helps identify potential inhibitors or activators of acetylcholinesterase.
Assay Information:

Details about the experiments used to measure bioactivity:
Assay type (e.g., binding assay, functional assay).
Conditions under which the activity was measured (e.g., cell-free systems or whole-cell assays).
Compound Information:

Structural data for the tested molecules, often in SMILES format.
Physicochemical properties of the molecules (e.g., molecular weight, logP).
Links to compound databases for more details (e.g., PubChem, DrugBank).
Target Context:

Information about acetylcholinesterase as the biological target:
Protein name and synonyms.
Organism (e.g., human, mouse, or other species).
UniProt ID for the protein.
